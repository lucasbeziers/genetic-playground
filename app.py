    Welcome to the Genetic Algorithm Playground! ðŸŽ‰
    
    This interactive page allows you to explore and experiment with **genetic algorithms (GA)** â€” a powerful optimization 
    technique inspired by the process of natural selection. With this tool, you can tweak various parameters of the algorithm 
    and see how they influence the performance and results. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics 
    or an enthusiast wanting to fine-tune parameters, this playground is designed for you!

    """
    Genetic algorithms are optimization techniques that mimic the process of natural evolution. 
    They are used to find solutions to problems by evolving a population of potential solutions over time. 
    Here are the key steps involved in a genetic algorithm:
    
    1. **Initialization**: A population of individuals (solutions) is randomly generated.
    2. **Evaluation**: Each individual is evaluated using a fitness function to determine its quality.
    3. **Selection**: The best-performing individuals are selected to pass their genes to the next generation.
    4. **Crossover**: Selected individuals are paired to produce offspring, combining their genes.
    5. **Mutation**: Random changes are introduced to some genes to maintain diversity.
    6. **Iteration**: Steps 2-5 are repeated for a fixed number of generations or until an optimal solution is found.
    
    In this playground, you can adjust parameters like population size, mutation rate and fitness function, 
    to observe how they affect the algorithm's ability to find optimal solutions.
